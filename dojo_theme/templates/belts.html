  The hacker ethos goes beyond the acquisition of a satisfactory grade in a college course.
  A true hacker is never satisfied with the state of their knowledge.
  They strive, or are irresistably driven towards, the achievement of absolute mastery of technical topics.
  </p>

  <p>
  Below is a list of true hackers: those who stared at the yellow box, and rather than flinching, dove in.
  </p>

  {% for belt_color in ("blue", "green", "yellow", "orange") %}
    <h2>{{belt_color.title()}} Belts</h2>
    <p>
    {% if belt_color == "blue" %}
    It is the rare individual who perseveres against the hardest of challenges, pushing on when the night is at its darkest.
    The hackers below are truly the most stout of spirit, fighting through countless seemingly-impossible challenges and proving themselves worthy to wear their blue belt among the clouds.
    {% elif belt_color == "green" %}
    A sapling grows toward the sun: a hacker emerges into the light.
    These individuals have shown a unique ability to see through the haze of uncertainty to the clarity beyond.
    They are ready to journey into the sky.
    {% elif belt_color == "yellow" %}
    The sky brightens as the sun rises.
    The minds of these students are opening, admitting phenomenal cybersecurity concepts that few even suspect to exist.
    With sunlight comes the possibility of growth and the promise of learning to come.
    {% elif belt_color == "orange" %}
    Dawn is on the horizon.
    No longer do the names written below belong to those unknowing cybersecurity: instead, their owners now realize the vast tracts of concepts still unexplored, waiting ready to expand their minds.
