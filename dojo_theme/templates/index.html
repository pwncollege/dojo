  <p>You have entered the pwn.college DOJO, an education platform for learners to develop and practice core cybersecurity skills in a hands-on fashion.
  Entering, you receive your "white belt" <img src="/belt/white.svg" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">, signifying the beginning of your hacker life.
  From here, you will learn cybersecurity by diving deep into the core of computing, using that journey to absorb cybersecurity concepts.
  This will involve melding your mind to your terminal, whispering instructions to the CPU, and strumming bits directly onto networks.
  That terminal cursor blinking above?
  It will be your stalwart companion through this adventure as you practice, earn your <a href="/belts">belts</a> <img src="/belt/orange.svg" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="/belt/yellow.svg" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="/belt/green.svg" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="/belt/blue.svg" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">, and, eventually, make perfect.

  <p>Every dojo has its sensei.
  This platform is maintained by an <a href="/sensei">awesome team</a> of hackers at Arizona State University.
  It powers much of ASU's cybersecurity curriculum, and is open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!

  <p>Enjoy your journey!

  <h2>The Rules</h2>
  <p>The challenges created for pwn.college are, first and foremost, educational material, and are used to grade students at universities around the world.
  Because of this, we would appreciate that you <b>do not post writeups, walkthrough videos, and livestreams of challenge solutions</b> to the internet.
  Obviously, we can't enforce this, but we worked hard to make all of this public, and we would appreciate your help in keeping pwn.college a viable educational platform.

  <div id="agreement-section" class="text-center mt-4 mb-4">
    <p>Please agree to these rules to continue to the material!<br>
    <button id="agree-button" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">I Agree to the Rules</button>
  </div>

  <div id="content-after-rules" style="display: none;">

  <h2>After pwn.college</h2>

  <p>Eventually, hackers continue their journey beyond pwn.college, becoming certain in their skills, achieving <i>brown belt</i> status (and able to, for example, usefully contribute to the cybersecurity industry and academia), before finally graduating to hacking masters: <i>black belts</i>.
  But this, unfortunately, must happen outside of the dojo (for now!).
  Some suggestions:

  <p>Capture The Flags (CTFs) are a great way to practice your hacking skills in a fun and ethical way. The most popular way to find upcoming events is at <a href="https://ctftime.org">https://ctftime.org</a>. There is also a list of introductory CTFs <a href="https://zaratec.io/ctf-practice/">here</a>. If you are at ASU, feel free to check out and join ASUâ€™s enigmatic <a href="http://asuhacking.club">hacking club</a>.

  <p>Wargames are another great way to practice your hacking skills. Whereas CTFs are short (normally 48 hour) events, wargames are not time-based. You can find a list of wargames at <a href="https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus">https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus</a>.

  <p>There are many other awesome learning platforms, such as <a href="https://cryptohack.org/">CryptoHack</a> and <a href="https://p.ost2.fyi/">OST2</a> that will help teach you explore new topics!

  <p>If you want to get involved with cybersecurity research, but donâ€™t know how, consider joining us for an <a href="https://sefcom.asu.edu/apprenticeship">internship at ASU</a>.
