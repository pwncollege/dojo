  <p>The material on pwn.college is split into a number of "dojos", with each dojo typically covering a high-level topic.
  <b>The material is designed to be tackled in order.</b>
  You can, of course, jump around, but keep in mind that each dojo expects you to know everything taught by the previous ones.

  <p><br><br>
  <h2>Getting Started &mdash; Learn the Basics!</h2>
  These first few dojos are designed to help you Get Started with the platform.
  Start here before venturing onwards!

  {{ dojo_grid(categorized_dojos["welcome"], dojo_container_counts) }}

  <p>After completing the dojos above, dive into the Core Material below!

  <p><br><br>
  <h2>Core Material &mdash; Earn Your Belts!</h2>

  <p>These dojos form the official pwn.college curriculum, taking you on a curated journey through the art of hacking.
  As you progress and build your skills, like in a martial art, you will earn <a href="belts">belts</a> for completing dojo after dojo.
  We won't stop you from jumping around if you want (and have the requisite skills), but you must earn belts sequentially.

  {{ dojo_grid(categorized_dojos["topic"], dojo_container_counts) }}

  <p>After completing the dojos above, not only will you be added to the <a href="belts">belts</a> page, but <i>we will send you actual pwn.college-embroidered belts</i>!
  <p>To get your belt, <a href="mailto:pwn@pwn.college">send us an email</a> from the email address associated with your pwn.college account.
  Weâ€™ll then get your belt over to you (eventually)!
  Note that, due to logistical challenges, we're currently only <i>shipping</i> belts to hackers after they earn their blue belt.
  Until then, we will belt you in person, at ASU or some security conference.

  <p id="community-dojos"><br><br>
  <h2>Community Material &mdash; Earn Badges!</h2>

  <p>No matter how much material we create, there is always more to learn!
  This section contains additional dojos created by the pwn.college community.
  Some are designed to be tackled after you complete the dojos above, whereas others are open to anyone interested in more specialized topics.

  <h2>The Courses &mdash; Earning Credit</h2>

  <p>We leverage the above material to run a number of courses on this platform.
  For the most part, these courses import the above material, though some might introduce new concepts and challenges.

  <h2>Dojos You've Joined &mdash; Keep Hacking!</h2>

  <p>These are the private dojos that have been shared with you.
  Keep hacking!

  <h2>Your Dojos &mdash; Challenge the World!</h2>
  <p>You can create your own dojo, either hosting your own challenges or remixing existing material!
  Once created, a dojo can be shared with your friends or students (providing a private scoreboard and curated experience) or made public to the world to appear in the Community Material list above!
