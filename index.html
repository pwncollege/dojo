# Getting Started

At the core of pwn.college is flags. How do you get those flags? Solve challenges. You can start a challenge by clicking on the `Challenges` tab at the top, selecting a module, clicking on a particular level, and hitting `Start`. In order to access that challenge, you have two options.

The first option is using the `Workspace` tab. This will present you with a fully functional development environment in your browser via Visual Studio Code. You can, for instance, quickly open a new terminal by pressing `F1`, searching for `New Terminal`, and pressing enter.

The second option is using `ssh`. In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must add a public ssh key to `Settings` > `SSH Key`. You can quickly generate an ssh key by running `ssh-keygen -f key -N ''` in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine. This will generate files `key` and `key.pub`, which are your private and public keys respectively. Once you have linked your ssh key to your account, you can run `ssh -i key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` to connect into your challenge instance.

Once you are in a challenge instance, your goal is to get the contents of the `/flag` file. Unfortunately for you, you are executing as the `hacker` user, but `/flag` is only readable by the `root` user. Fortunately, however, there are challenge programs located inside of the `/challenge` directory, which when run, will run with the privileges of the `root` user. Solve the challenge to get the `/flag`, and then submit it in order to complete the challenge!

A few things to note. Your home directory `/home/hacker` is persistent. This means that when you start a new challenge, all of the files you have saved in there will still be there. The `Practice` button can be incredibly useful for debugging your solution. When you start a challenge in this way, you will have the ability to run programs as the `root` user with the `sudo` command; however, the instance will only have a practice flag. For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine. You can interact with the virtual machine using the `vm` command.

# About

pwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames. The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”.

pwn.college was created by [Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)](https://yancomm.net) and [kanak (Connor Nelson)](https://connornelson.com) at Arizona State University. It powers ASU’s Computer Systems Security course, CSE466, and is now open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!
