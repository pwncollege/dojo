### Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to learn how to contribute to the pwncollege dojo! We greatly appreciate every type of contribution, whether it's a bug report, a new feature, a security report or just a small fix in the docs.
Every type of contribution helps the whole community of pwncollege, and improves the learning experience for everyone.

In this file we're going to be walking through how to contribute to pwncollege, and what we expect from our contributors.

### Bug Reports
When submitting a bug report, make sure to follow these guidelines:

1. Check that the issue doesn't already exist
2. Always write the steps to reproduce the bug (or if you can't reproduce it, write that in your report).
3. Write in your report what happens, and what you expect to happen.
4. If you know what part of the code results in that bug, and don't know how to fix it, make sure to mention where that code is!
