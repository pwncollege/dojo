# History

In the Fall of 2018, tasked with the responsibility of teaching *Computer Systems Security* to a little over a hundred fourth-year undergraduate students at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), we were faced with a challenge: how do we best teach hundreds of students to become skilled *hackers* in just a single semester?
With a background in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, as members of [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net) and the DEF CON CTF organizing team [Order of the Overflow](https://www.oooverflow.io), we realized our best chance was to teach the course in the same way we learned: by doing.
And so, the night before the first lecture, at a coffee shop in Tempe, Arizona---late into the night---we bought the domain [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), created the first assignment, and glued together a simple netcat interface in what would become [the first version]((https://github.com/pwncollege/oldschool)) of the pwn.college DOJO.
